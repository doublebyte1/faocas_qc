-- Introduction ------------
We want to build customtimectrl and customtimectrld, directly in the QT plugins/designer directory, so you dont need to do anything.

-- Build on VS --
On the project using the plugin, you must:
- add the include path of this project to the include path of the project
- add $(QTDIR)\plugins\designer to the library path
- add customtimectrl.lib to the libraries
- copy dlls to the path of the application

And everyting should be fine and the widget should "magically" appear on the designer!
Have fun!!! :-))


---- QUICK WAY TO BUILD (on the command line) ----------------
in the project path:

Windows:

1 - nmake debug & nmake release
7 - copy %QTDIR%\plugins\designer\customTimeCtrl*.dll to the directory of the project/program that uses the plugin

Linux:

1 - make debug & make release
7 - copy  $$[QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS]\designer\customTimeCtrl*.so to the directory of the project/program that uses the plugin]


explanation:
- build debug version
- build release version
- (eventually) copy the shared libraries to the directory of the project that uses this plugin
